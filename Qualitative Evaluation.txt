Qualitative Evaluation
======================================

After looked at clustering results with K=3,4,5, we found the result generated by LDA with K=4 is the best.

In the case K = 3, both models identify groups talking about 'Hillary Clinton', 'Planed Parenthood' and 'Abortion'. However, word 'hillari' ranks not that high in the corresponding group. So we doubt that this group may contain two different topics. 

In the case K = 4, LDA successfully divides the previous group of 'Hillary Clinton' into two more specific groups - 'Hillary Clinton' and 'Thank God'. Words 'God' and 'Hillary' get very high rank in the corresponding group. However, BTM generates a general topic with top words being 'rt','dont','like'.

In the case K = 5, LDA generates a general topic with top words being 'dont','peopl','know' while BTM identifies a more specific topic 'promisedland' from previous 'Hillary Clinton' topic.

So we can not really say which model produces better clustering. I can only decide after some experiments.
